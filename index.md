I completed my Ph.D. in computer science in the [Advanced Computing Laboratory](https://acl.inf.ethz.ch) at the Computer Science Department of ETH Zurich, and I am currently a postdoc in the [SPIRAL team](https://spiral.net) at the Electrical And Computer Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University. 

My research interests include the design of domain-specific languages for high-performance mathematical software.

During my Ph.D. I investigated the problem of generating efficient code for small-scale, dense linear algebra programs. This eventual lead to the development of the [LGen and the SLinGen program generators](https://acl.inf.ethz.ch/research/LGen/).
